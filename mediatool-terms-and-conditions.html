<h3 id="section-ii--obligations-of-the-parties">SECTION II – OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES</h3>
<p><em>Clause 6</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Description of processing(s)</em></strong></p>
<p>The details of the processing operations, in particular the categories of personal data and the purposes of processing for which the personal data is processed on behalf of the controller, are specified in Annex II.</p>
<p><em>Clause 7</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Obligations of the Parties</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>7.1 Instructions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The processor shall process personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject. In this case, the processor shall inform the controller of that legal requirement before processing, unless the law prohibits this on important grounds of public interest. Subsequent instructions may also be given by the controller throughout the duration of the processing of personal data. These instructions shall always be documented.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The processor shall immediately inform the controller if, in the processor’s opinion, instructions given by the controller infringe Regulation (EU) 2016/679 / Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 or the applicable Union or Member State data protection provisions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>7.2 Purpose limitation</strong></p>
<p>The processor shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the processing, as set out in Annex II, unless it receives further instructions from the controller.</p>
<p><strong>7.3 Duration of the processing of personal data</strong></p>
<p>Processing by the processor shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex II.</p>
<p><strong>7.4 Security of processing</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The processor shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex III to ensure the security of the personal data. This includes protecting the data against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to the data (personal data breach). In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing and the risks involved for the data subjects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The processor shall grant access to the personal data undergoing processing to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for implementing, managing and monitoring of the contract. The processor shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data received have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>7.5 Sensitive data</strong></p>
<p>If the processing involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (“sensitive data”), the processor shall apply specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards.</p>
<p><strong>7.6 Documentation and compliance</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The processor shall deal promptly and adequately with inquiries from the controller about the processing of data in accordance with these Clauses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The processor shall make available to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations that are set out in these Clauses and stem directly from Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and/or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. At the controller’s request, the processor shall also permit and contribute to audits of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of non-compliance. In deciding on a review or an audit, the controller may take into account relevant certifications held by the processor.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The controller may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor. Audits may also include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the processor and shall, where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Parties shall make the information referred to in this Clause, including the results of any audits, available to the competent supervisory authority/ies on request.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>7.7 Use of sub-processors</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The processor has the controller’s general authorisation for the engagement of sub-processors from an agreed list. The processor shall specifically inform in writing the controller of any intended changes of that list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors at least two weeks in advance, thereby giving the controller sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the concerned sub-processor(s). The processor shall provide the controller with the information necessary to enable the controller to exercise the right to object.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Where the processor engages a sub-processor for carrying out specific processing activities (on behalf of the controller), it shall do so by way of a contract which imposes on the sub-processor, in substance, the same data protection obligations as the ones imposed on the data processor in accordance with these Clauses. The processor shall ensure that the sub-processor complies with the obligations to which the processor is subject pursuant to these Clauses and to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and/or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.</p>
</li>
<li><p>At the controller’s request, the processor shall provide a copy of such a sub-processor agreement and any subsequent amendments to the controller. To the extent necessary to protect business secret or other confidential information, including personal data, the processor may redact the text of the agreement prior to sharing the copy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The processor shall remain fully responsible to the controller for the performance of the sub-processor’s obligations in accordance with its contract with the processor. The processor shall notify the controller of any failure by the sub-processor to fulfil its contractual obligations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The processor shall agree a third party beneficiary clause with the sub-processor whereby - in the event the processor has factually disappeared, ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent - the controller shall have the right to terminate the sub-processor contract and to instruct the sub-processor to erase or return the personal data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>7.8 International transfers</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Any transfer of data to a third country or an international organisation by the processor shall be done only on the basis of documented instructions from the controller or in order to fulfil a specific requirement under Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject and shall take place in compliance with Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The controller agrees that where the processor engages a sub-processor in accordance with Clause 7.7. for carrying out specific processing activities (on behalf of the controller) and those processing activities involve a transfer of personal data within the meaning of Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the processor and the sub-processor can ensure compliance with Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 by using standard contractual clauses adopted by the Commission in accordance with of Article 46(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, provided the conditions for the use of those standard contractual clauses are met.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Clause 8</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Assistance to the controller</em></strong></p>

<h3 id="annex-iii-technical-and-organisational-measures-including-technical-and-organisational-measures-to-ensure-the-security-of-the-data"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">ANNEX III TECHNICAL AND ORGANISATIONAL MEASURES INCLUDING TECHNICAL AND ORGANISATIONAL MEASURES TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF THE DATA</span></h3>
<p>The security of our customers&#39; data is a top priority at Mediatool. Safeguarding data is a critical responsibility we have to our customers, and we work hard to maintain that trust. We aim to be transparent about our security practices.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate security</strong></p>
<p>Mediatool’s employees are required to study and follow internal security policies and standards. Before access to any internal system is granted, personnel must agree to confidentiality terms and attend security training. This training covers device security, privacy, physical security and incident reporting etc.</p>
<p>All employees are bound to our policy regarding customer data as specified by our terms and conditions, <a href="http://www.mediatool.com/termsandconditions">http://www.mediatool.com/termsandconditions</a>. Some employees such as developers or customer support staff, which might have elevated access to systems and customer data, receive additional training related to security.</p>
<p>When an employee leaves the company all access to Mediatool systems is removed immediately.</p>
<p>Mediatool performs background checks on all new hires including verification of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identity verification</li>
<li>References</li>
<li>Criminal records check</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Access control</strong></p>
<p>Mediatool adheres to the standard security principles of least privilege and role based-permission when provisioning access. Employees are only authorized to access data they explicitly need to in order to do their jobs. User access is reviewed regularly every quarter to ensure the access granted is still relevant for that specific user. When hired, employees might be granted access to a small number of internal corporate systems. Any additional access must be approved by the responsible manager while access to the production environment must be approved by the CSO.</p>
<p>All systems used at Mediatool require users to authenticate. When applicable Mediatool employs multi-factor authentication for administrative access to all systems used internally. All Mediatool employees are required to use password managers to generate and securely store sufficiently complex passwords.</p>
<p><strong>Customer data security</strong></p>
<p>Preventing unauthorised access to customer data is a top priority at Mediatool. We continuously work to identify and mitigate security risks by implementing best practices.</p>
<p>Mediatool’s customer data is hosted in our shared infrastructure. Mediatool uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host all services. This means our servers are located in secure data centers that offer state of the art physical protection and infrastructure. AWS meets all standard infrastructure compliance requirements, regarding availability, network protection and disaster recovery. AWS is responsible for restricting physical access to Mediatool’s systems to authorised personnel only. More information about Amazon’s compliance programs can be found at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/">https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/</a>. Mediatool employees do not have physical access to AWS data centers, servers, network equipment or storage.</p>
<p>All data in transit between Mediatool clients and servers is encrypted using strong encryption protocols. Mediatool supports the latest recommended secure ciphers suits to encrypt all traffic in transit (TLS 1.2 protocols, AES256-encryption) and can be used when supported by clients. We always follow the latest cryptographic recommendations and upgrade cipher suite choices when needed.</p>
<p>All data at rest in Mediatool’s production environment is encrypted (using AES256-encryption). This includes production databases, file stores and backups.</p>
<p><strong>Network and Server Security</strong></p>
<p>In order to protect production data, Mediatool hosts testing and development environments in separate networks from the production infrastructure. All servers within the production infrastructure are hardened with all unnecessary ports disabled etc. A base configuration that follow CIS benchmark configuration guidelines is applied to all servers across the infrastructure.</p>
<p>Public network access to Mediatool’s production environment is restricted and only a small number of servers are accessible from the Internet. Only network protocols that are essential for Mediatool to be able to provide its services are open on our production servers.</p>
<p>Mediatool is the assigned administrator of its infrastructure on AWS and access is restricted to designated personnel in Mediatool’s operations team. Specific keys are required in order to access servers and keys are stored in a secure and encrypted location.</p>
<p>For Intrusion detection and prevention activities (IDS/IPS), Mediatool logs, monitors and audits all system calls and has alerts in place for any system calls that could indicate intrusion.</p>
<p>Mediatool undergoes annual penetration testing conducted by an independent third party security company. Mediatool provides the testers with an isolated replica of our production environment. No customer data is exposed through testing. A summary of penetration test findings are available for enterprise customers upon request.</p>
<p><strong>Application security</strong></p>
<p><strong>Two factor authentication</strong></p>
<p>2FA adds an additional layer of security to Mediatool via a time based one-time password (TOTP). We encourage all organizations to use 2FA to secure data from intruders. Mediatool displays which users have 2FA enabled in the organization&#39;s user list.</p>
<p><strong>Rest API authentication</strong></p>
<p>An auth token is used for authentication when using the REST API. The token is passed using the authentication header and used to authenticate a user account with the API.</p>
<p><strong>Role based access control</strong></p>
<p>User access to their organizations on Mediatool is completely controlled by the customer’s admin users through a user/role settings page. From that page it&#39;s possible to assign/revoke roles (admin, editor, viewer) and also invite/remove users.</p>
<p>Current roles we support by default:</p>
<p>Admin - Full access to organization. Can invite users/grant permissions/modify data</p>
<p>Editor - Can create/modify certain data.</p>
<p>Viewer - Can read certain data.</p>
<p>Restricted - A setting that can be applied to any above role. This restricts access to specific data. For example you can restrict access to data involving budget or other sensitive information that you don&#39;t want certain users to see or modify.</p>
<p><strong>Application development security practices</strong></p>
<p>Every member of the Mediatool team is very security minded. We know that every person and team using our services expect their data to be secure and confidential. Security is deeply integrated in our software development lifecycle (SDLC) and well known best practices are applied to every step. All production code is subject to the following coding policies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The security risk of every new feature, functionality and design change is assessed by our development team. Risk analysis leverages both the development team’s experience and well known security guidelines such as OWASP top 10.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All code changes are audited with automated static analysis software such as linting.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All code changes are subject to manual peer-review for security vulnerabilities and code quality.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Automated testing. No code is deployed to production without passing a rigorous test suite that’s part of our continuous integration process.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Automated vulnerability scans. All used open source code is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities and licence compliance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use of libraries. We use updated, well known and well tested libraries, both in the front end and the back end applications.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Regular use of security assessments such as application-level penetration tests.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In house development. All development happens in-house following our development policies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data retention and Destruction</strong></p>
<p>Mediatool will retain organization media data in accordance with the customer&#39;s instructions and as required by applicable law. Organization media data may be removed or obfuscated within 6 months after the organization account is closed, unless we’re explicitly instructed by the customer to remove the data immediately. Data can also be deleted via Mediatool’s REST API and through the UI.</p>
<p>Personal data for users such as business email, name and phone number are retained for as long as the user account is active. Mediatool will handle this personal information in accordance with our Privacy Policy listed at <a href="https://mediatool.com/cookies/">https://mediatool.com/cookies/</a></p>
<p>Mediatool’s hosting provider is responsible for ensuring that data is removed from disk in a responsible manner before they are repurposed.</p>
<p><strong>Disaster Recovery</strong></p>
<p>Mediatool uses different services deployed by our hosting provider in order to protect from a disaster that causes loss of connectivity, power infrastructure or other types of failures in the region where Mediatool’s production environment is hosted. To handle a disaster the production environment is duplicated across separate regions. A duplicate set of all production resources are kept in stand-by in order to provide availability to Mediatool’s services should a disaster occur. Production data is continuously replicated to this separate region in order to minimize data loss during a disaster. Additionally, a full backup copy of production data is taken daily and stored in a separate region from the production environment. Backups are tested every quarter to ensure they can be successfully restored.</p>
<p><strong>Security incidents</strong></p>
<p>Mediatool has an established incident response policy for handling potential security incidents. All security incidents are managed by the CSO and the security team. The policy defines the reporting, evaluation and mitigation process that takes place, as well as the classification scheme for incident severity. In the event of an incident, affected customers will be informed via email by the customer success team.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Parties shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including during transmission, and protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access (hereinafter “personal data breach”). In assessing the appropriate level of security, they shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature of the personal data, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects, and in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The data exporter shall assist the data importer in ensuring appropriate security of the data in accordance with paragraph (a). In case of a personal data breach concerning the personal data processed by the data exporter under these Clauses, the data exporter shall notify the data importer without undue delay after becoming aware of it and assist the data importer in addressing the breach.</p>

</ol>
<p><em>Clause 13 – not applicable</em></p>
<h3 id="section-iii--local-laws-and-obligations-in-case-of-access-by-public-authorities"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">SECTION III – LOCAL LAWS AND OBLIGATIONS IN CASE OF ACCESS BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES</span></h3>
<p><em>Clause 14</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses</em></strong></p>
<p><em>(where the EU processor combines the personal data received from the third country-controller with personal data collected by the processor in the EU)</em></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:</p>
</li>
<li><p>the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;</p>
</li>
<li><p>the laws and practices of the third country of destination– including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such authorities – relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards;</p>
</li>
<li><p>any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Clause 15</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Obligations of the data importer in case of access by public authorities</em></strong></p>
<p><em>(where the EU processor combines the personal data received from the third country-controller with personal data collected by the processor in the EU)</em></p>
<p><strong>15.1    Notification</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter and, where possible, the data subject promptly (if necessary with the help of the data exporter) if it:</p>
<ol>
<li>receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws of the country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses; such notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided; or</li>
<li>becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of destination; such notification shall include all information available to the importer.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these Clauses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>15.2    Review of legality and data minimisation</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity. The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data importer under Clause 14(e).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="section-iv--final-provisions"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">SECTION IV – FINAL PROVISIONS</span></h3>
<p><em>Clause 16</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Non-compliance with the Clauses and termination</em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses, where:</p>
</li>
<li><p>the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in any event within one month of suspension;</p>
</li>
<li><p>the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses; or</p>
</li>
<li><p>the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its obligations under these Clauses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority of such non-compliance. Where the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>Personal data collected by the data exporter in the EU that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall immediately be deleted in its entirety, including any copy thereof. The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the transferred personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process the data to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a decision pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal data to which these Clauses apply; or (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal framework of the country to which the personal data is transferred. This is without prejudice to other obligations applying to the processing in question under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Clause 17</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Governing law</em></strong></p>
<p>These Clauses shall be governed by the law of a country allowing for third-party beneficiary rights. The Parties agree that this shall be the law of Sweden.</p>
<p><em>Clause 18</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Choice of forum and jurisdiction</em></strong></p>
<p>Any dispute arising from these Clauses shall be resolved by the courts of Sweden.</p>

<p><em>Clause 8</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Data protection safeguards</em></strong></p>
<p>The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses.</p>
<p><strong>8.1    Purpose limitation</strong></p>
<p>The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B. It may only process the personal data for another purpose:</p>
<ol>
<li>where it has obtained the data subject’s prior consent;</li>
<li>where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or</li>
<li>where necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>8.2    Transparency</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>In order to enable data subjects to effectively exercise their rights pursuant to Clause 10, the data importer shall inform them, either directly or through the data exporter:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>of its identity and contact details;</p>
</li>
<li><p>of the categories of personal data processed;</p>
</li>
<li><p>of the right to obtain a copy of these Clauses;</p>
</li>
<li><p>where it intends to onward transfer the personal data to any third party/ies, of the recipient or categories of recipients (as appropriate with a view to providing meaningful information), the purpose of such onward transfer and the ground therefore pursuant to Clause 8.7.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Paragraph (a) shall not apply where the data subject already has the information, including when such information has already been provided by the data exporter, or providing the information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort for the data importer. In the latter case, the data importer shall, to the extent possible, make the information publicly available.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On request, the Parties shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by them, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the Parties may redact part of the text of the Appendix prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>8.3    Accuracy and data minimisation</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Each Party shall ensure that the personal data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. The data importer shall take every reasonable step to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purpose(s) of processing, is erased or rectified without delay.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If one of the Parties becomes aware that the personal data it has transferred or received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the other Party without undue delay.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The data importer shall ensure that the personal data is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose(s) of processing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>8.4    Storage limitation</strong></p>
<p>The data importer shall retain the personal data for no longer than necessary for the purpose(s) for which it is processed. It shall put in place appropriate technical or organisational measures to ensure compliance with this obligation, including erasure or anonymisation of the data and all back-ups at the end of the retention period.</p>
<p><strong>8.5    Security of processing</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the personal data, including  protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access (hereinafter “personal data breach”). In assessing the appropriate level of security, they shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subject. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Parties have agreed on the technical and organisational measures set out in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The data importer shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the personal data breach, including measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In case of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data importer shall without undue delay notify both the data exporter and the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13. Such notification shall contain i) a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), ii) its likely consequences, iii) the measures taken or proposed to address the breach, and iv) the details of a contact point from whom more information can be obtained. To the extent it is not possible for the data importer to provide all the information at the same time, it may do so in phases without undue further delay.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In case of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data importer shall also notify without undue delay the data subjects concerned of the personal data breach and its nature, if necessary in cooperation with the data exporter, together with the information referred to in paragraph (e), points ii) to iv), unless the data importer has implemented measures to significantly reduce the risk to the rights or freedoms of natural persons, or notification would involve disproportionate efforts. In the latter case, the data importer shall instead issue a public communication or take a similar measure to inform the public of the personal data breach.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The data importer shall document all relevant facts relating to the personal data breach, including its effects and any remedial action taken, and keep a record thereof.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>8.6    Sensitive data</strong></p>
<p>Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions or offences (hereinafter “sensitive data”), the data importer shall apply specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards adapted to the specific nature of the data and the risks involved. This may include restricting the personnel permitted to access the personal data, additional security measures (such as pseudonymisation) and/or additional restrictions with respect to further disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>8.7    Onward transfers</strong></p>
<p>The data importer shall not disclose the personal data to a third party located outside the European Union (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter “onward transfer”) unless the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module. Otherwise, an onward transfer by the data importer may only take place if:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>it is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;</p>
</li>
<li><p>the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;</p>
</li>
<li><p>the third party enters into a binding instrument with the data importer ensuring the same level of data protection as under these Clauses, and the data importer provides a copy of these safeguards to the data exporter;</p>
</li>
<li><p>it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings;</p>
</li>
<li><p>it is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; or</p>
</li>
<li><p>where none of the other conditions apply, the data importer has obtained the explicit consent of the data subject for an onward transfer in a specific situation, after having informed him/her of its purpose(s), the identity of the recipient and the possible risks of such transfer to him/her due to the lack of appropriate data protection safeguards. In this case, the data importer shall inform the data exporter and, at the request of the latter, shall transmit to it a copy of the information provided to the data subject.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.</p>
<p><strong>8.8    Processing under the authority of the data importer</strong></p>
<p>The data importer shall ensure that any person acting under its authority, including a processor, processes the data only on its instructions.</p>
<p><strong>8.9    Documentation and compliance</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Each Party shall be able to demonstrate compliance with its obligations under these Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate documentation of the processing activities carried out under its responsibility.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The data importer, where relevant with the assistance of the data exporter, shall deal with any enquiries and requests it receives from a data subject relating to the processing of his/her personal data and the exercise of his/her rights under these Clauses without undue delay and at the latest within one month of the receipt of the enquiry or request. The data importer shall take appropriate measures to facilitate such enquiries, requests and the exercise of data subject rights. Any information provided to the data subject shall be in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In particular, upon request by the data subject the data importer shall, free of charge:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>provide confirmation to the data subject as to whether personal data concerning him/her is being processed and, where this is the case, a copy of the data relating to him/her and the information in Annex I; if personal data has been or will be onward transferred, provide information on recipients or categories of recipients (as appropriate with a view to providing meaningful information) to which the personal data has been or will be onward transferred, the purpose of such onward transfers and their ground pursuant to Clause 8.7; and provide information on the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in accordance with Clause 12(c)(i);</p>
</li>
<li><p>rectify inaccurate or incomplete data concerning the data subject;</p>

</li>
<li><p>Where the data importer processes the personal data for direct marketing purposes, it shall cease processing for such purposes if the data subject objects to it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The data importer shall not make a decision based solely on the automated processing of the personal data transferred (hereinafter “automated decision”), which would produce legal effects concerning the data subject or similarly significantly affect him / her, unless with the explicit consent of the data subject or if authorised to do so under the laws of the country of destination, provided that such laws lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and legitimate interests. In this case, the data importer shall, where necessary in cooperation with the data exporter:</p>
<ol>
<li>inform the data subject about the envisaged automated decision, the envisaged consequences and the logic involved; and</li>
<li>implement suitable safeguards, at least by enabling the data subject to contest the decision, express his/her point of view and obtain review by a human being.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Where requests from a data subject are excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, the data importer may either charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of granting the request or refuse to act on the request.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The data importer may refuse a data subject’s request if such refusal is allowed under the laws of the country of destination and is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to protect one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the data importer intends to refuse a data subject’s request, it shall inform the data subject of the reasons for the refusal and the possibility of lodging a complaint with the competent supervisory authority and/or seeking judicial redress.</p>

The Parties shall keep each other informed about such disputes and, where appropriate, cooperate in resolving them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Where the data subject invokes a third-party beneficiary right pursuant to Clause 3, the data importer shall accept the decision of the data subject to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the Member State of his/her habitual residence or place of work, or the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13;</p>
</li>
<li><p>refer the dispute to the competent courts within the meaning of Clause 18.</p>

<p><em>Clause 14</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses</em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;</p>
</li>
<li><p>the laws and practices of the third country of destination– including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such authorities – relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards;</p>
</li>
<li><p>any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.

<ol>
<li><p>The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter and, where possible, the data subject promptly (if necessary with the help of the data exporter) if it:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws of the country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses; such notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided; or</p>
</li>
<li><p>becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of destination; such notification shall include all information available to the importer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these Clauses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>15.2    Review of legality and data minimisation</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity. The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data importer under Clause 14(e).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.</p>

<li><p>The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses, where:</p>

</ol>
<p> In these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority of such non-compliance. Where the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety. The same shall apply to any copies of the data. The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses.
